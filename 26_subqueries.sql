-- Creation of a new database
-- This command creates a new database named mydb. It's the initial step in organizing our data.
CREATE DATABASE mydb;

-- Selection of the newly created database
-- After creating the database, this command switches the context to the mydb database, so all subsequent operations are performed within this database.
USE mydb;

-- Creation of a table
-- This command creates a new table named 'emploees' (which appears to be a typo and is later corrected to 'employees'). The table structure includes columns for employee details such as ID, name, pay, job, hire date, and supervisor.
CREATE TABLE emploees(
	employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT, -- Unique ID for each employee, auto-increments for new entries
    first_name VARCHAR(25), -- Employee's first name, up to 25 characters
    last_name VARCHAR(25), -- Employee's last name, up to 25 characters
    hourly_pay DECIMAL(2,2), -- Hourly pay, mistakenly limited to 99 cents, will be corrected later
    job VARCHAR(10), -- Job title, limited to 10 characters, will be expanded later
    hire_date DATE, -- Date of hire, in YYYY-MM-DD format
    supervisor_id INT -- ID of the employee's supervisor
);

-- Correcting the table name
-- This command corrects the typo in the table name from 'emploees' to the correct 'employees'.
ALTER TABLE emploees RENAME TO employees;

-- Modifying the structure of the hourly_pay column
-- This command corrects the decimal places for hourly_pay, allowing values up to 9999.99 instead of being incorrectly limited before.
ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN hourly_pay DECIMAL(4,2);

-- Expanding the job title column
-- This command alters the 'job' column to allow for longer job titles, expanding the limit from 10 to 14 characters.
ALTER TABLE employees MODIFY COLUMN job VARCHAR(14);

-- Inserting data into the employees table
-- These commands insert records into the employees table for various fictional characters, setting up their employee details.
